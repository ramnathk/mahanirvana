The former was too daunting for me to attempt reading and the latter lacked any meaningful detail for practical application of the treatise The all english translations of mantras by Sir John Woodroffe miss out on the ‘sound’\ne.g. Chapter 9 says\n\nHring, Salutation to the raw-meat eaters: Svaha (18).\n\nThat for anyone, trying to understand and practice the mantra is useless!\nAt the same time, the Hindi translations by Baldev Prasad  Mishra didn’t seem interesting as my grasp of Hindi is not that much more than my grasp of Sanskrit!"
