title: Why Yet Another Mahanirvana Tantra?
---

The other books I found were all either in Sanskrit or entirely English. The
former was too daunting for me to attempt reading and the latter lacked any
meaningful detail for practical application of the treatise The all english
translations of mantras by Sir John Woodroffe miss out on the 'sound'

e.g. Chapter 9 says

> Hring, Salutation to the raw-meat eaters: Svaha (18).

That for anyone, trying to understand and practice the mantra is useless!

At the same time, the Hindi translations by Baldev Prasad  Mishra didn't seem
interesting as my grasp of Hindi is not that much more than my grasp of
Sanskrit!
